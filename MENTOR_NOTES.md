## For the mentor: ask the class these questions to solidify understanding: 

1. What is **npm**? What does it do?
> npm is a Node Package Manager. Each package is a module of code that can be imported and utilised within our scripts.

2. What is the difference between `npm init` and `npm install`? In which order would you run the two?
> npm init initialies the project with package.json within a project. npm install give access to specific modules to be used within the script.
3. What is a `.gitignore` file and why might we use it?
> We use the .gitignore file to remove unecessary npm files from our commits. We want github to leave the files alone!
4. Which flag saves a module globally? What might the disadvantages of doing this be?
> -g . uses space on your machine, so its unecessary when you only need it for one project.
5. Which flag would you use to save a dev dependency? How would you turn a dependency into a dev dependency?
> -D. You would edit the package.json file manually.
